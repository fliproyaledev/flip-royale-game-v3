@dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.\n Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier\n available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested\n (reentrant) calls to them.\n Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as\n `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":1038,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1038],"name":"ReentrancyGuard","nameLocation":"1048:15:9","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"constant":true,"id":975,"mutability":"constant","name":"NOT_ENTERED","nameLocation":"1843:11:9","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1038,"src":"1818:40:9","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":973,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1818:7:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"value":{"hexValue":"31","id":974,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"1857:1:9","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_1_by_1","typeString":"int_const

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.
